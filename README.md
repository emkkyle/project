###Our Idea
"According to a recent national survery, 54 percent of Americans earning less than $30,000 went to art museums once a year or never, and more than half of them reported that discomfort was the major reason." pg 8 of "Popular Culture & High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste" by Herbert J. Gans

We wanted to create a gateway for people who feel excluded from the art scene or museums by introducing them with something we all know very well: our own music taste.
