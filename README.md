#### Spotify-based project for SheInnovates Hackathon

##### Team members: Annabelle Cotton and Emily Kyle

## Our Idea
> "According to a recent national survery, 54 percent of Americans earning less than $30,000 went to art museums once a year or never, and more than half of them reported that discomfort was the major reason." 
> 
> "Popular Culture & High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste" by Herbert J. Gans

We wanted to create a gateway for people who feel excluded from the art scene or museums by introducing them with something we all know very well: our own music taste.

### SheInnovates
SheInnovates is the University of Pittsburgh's annual women's hackathon. It is hosted by the School of Computing and Information, in partnership with the Big Idea Center and Women in Computer Science club (WiCS) The 2023 hackathon is sponsered by PNC Bank, CGI, the Naval Nuclear Laboratory, and NetApp. Here is the [judging rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MDOe1yl4DQILHfdKdZqc7tX816J4dKos/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102679682680888862809&rtpof=true&sd=true).

#### About the Process
It was both of our first hackathons. We went into Friday night thinking that we were going to put no pressure on ourselvesâ€”regardless of how our project turned out or how far through it we got, we would have had meaningful experiences at the bare minumum. Soon after we discussed this, we became fully invested in our project.

Although we did not complete a fully functioning project at the end of the hackathon, we worked afterwards to complete it because we wanted to be able to showcase our final product.
